This is an editor for making 2D SNES era RPG like games. The games are composed
of plain text files, images and a index.html file containing [the engine](https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmkJsEngine).

The goal is that these plain text files should be easy to be read by humans and
software.

Dependencies
------------

This tool is written using Python 3. Needs `pillow`, `numpy` and `PyQt5` -
you can `apt install python3-pyqt5` and similar (in Ubuntu) or use pip.

If you satisfy all dependencies you don't need to install, and [can run from source](#running-from-source).

Experimental compatibility to python2 (2.7 and on) is added to versions above
0.3.0 .

Known Issues with PyQt5 in Ubuntu
---------------------------------

### Application has no keyboard shortcuts

If instead of using pip3 you are installing dependencies using `apt install`,
the menu will be nicely integrated. Unfortunately, keyboard shortcuts won't
work.
