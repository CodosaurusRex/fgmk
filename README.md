=============================

This is a way describe a type of game in json files, a javascipt engine to play it and a pyqt application to make it.

There is a Wiki (I think it's on the right side, I'm on Nano) so click in there because I will be updating there more often.

Right now this code is using PyQt on the maker side, so assume everything here is GPLv2 until I decide better.

Also the javascript code is based on the source of the game Redo, made by Lino, in the Global Game Jam 2012. [In this article, he is the guy with an Ipad and I'm the electric engineer here](http://www.kotaku.com.br/quarenta-e-oito-horas-aprendendo-a-fazer-games-na-global-game-jam/)
