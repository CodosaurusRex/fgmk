Specification
=============

The engine and the editor expects some files, and that they are
organized in the following manner.

Here is how the file tree should be organized

::

    game_project_name
    ├── audio
    ├── descriptors
    │   ├── charaset
    │   │   └── charaset1.json
    │   ├── charas.json
    │   ├── feedback.json
    │   ├── hms.json
    │   ├── init.json
    │   ├── items.json
    │   └── levels
    │       ├── ahouse.map.json
    │       └── house.pal.json
    |        ...

-  ``audio`` (folder) - contains audio files used by the game.

-  ``descriptors`` (folder) - contains all json files, and folders
   containing json files.

   -  ``charaset`` (folder) - this folder contains the different jsons
      that describes the animations you use with Charas.

   OBS: right now only a single file that has to be named
   ``charaset1.json`` is possible. Soon this won't be a requirement.

   -  ``charas.json`` - things that you can place in any the map, they
      can move and trigger actions, and usually represent the non
      playable characters you interact in the game.

   -  ``feedback.json`` - deals with the engine feedback, right now only
      colision and the sound when outputing text. This should be moved
      inside the engine soon.

   -  ``hms.json`` - Heroes, Monsters and Skills, this file describes
      all the heroes that you can add to the party, all the monsters you
      can fight against, and the skills that they can have.

   -  ``init.json`` - where does the game starts, who is in the party,
      and some things that didn't fit anywhere else.

   -  ``items.json`` - has the description of the items, how do they
      work, what they are.

   -  ``scriptedbattles.json`` - has the description of a scripted
      battle, what monsters are involved and how each script is
      triggered.

   -  ``levels`` (folder) - this folder contains levels (.map.json
      files) and possible palettes (.pal.json files) to use when
      designing levels.

-  ``img`` (folder) - this folder contains all the image files in png
   format.

   -  ``pictures`` (folder) - you can show a picture using action, this
      folder contains possible pictures in png format.

-  ``font`` (folder) - holds the type font for the engine. Currently it
   MUST be INFO56\_0.

OBS: Soon the font name will be placed in init.json, so you will be able
to change this.

-  ``index.html`` - this is the engine. It should be placed at the root
   of the game project folder.

`*back* <../index.html>`__
