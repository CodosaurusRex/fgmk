Installation
============

**fgmk** is packed as a regular Python project, in the `Python Package
Indexer <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fgmk>`__.

As such, installation is fairly easy, and easier if you already have
Python installed.

Recommended Install and run
---------------------------

If you are already familiar with Python, just use the commands below in
your terminal to install and run **fgmk**.

::

    pip3 install fgmk
    fgmk

   Installation on Windows with pip

In Windows, install Python 3 from
`www.python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__, and then open
**.html.exe** and type (press enter after):

::

    python -m pip install fgmk

To run, you can type the following in **.html.exe** or the **run...**
prompt:

::

    python -m fgmk

If your python/scripts folder is in your Windows PATH, you can omit the
preceding ``python -m`` command, and just type ``pip install fgmk`` and
then ``fgmk``.

Unix install and run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First you need ``pip3`` for ``Python3``.

-  in Ubuntu or Debian, open the terminal and use
   ``sudo apt install python3-pip``.

-  After you will be able to run ``pip3 install fgmk``. You can just
   type ``fgmk`` at command line to launch the editor.

-  In Ubuntu, **fgmk** will be also added to the Unity Applications
   entry.

From Source Installation
------------------------

Clone this repository, meet the dependencies and install this with pip3.

::

    git clone https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmk.git
    cd fgmk
    pip3 install .

Running from source
-------------------

Clone this repository, meet the dependencies and type
``python3 -m fgmk``

::

    git clone https://github.com/ericoporto/fgmk.git
    cd fgmk
    python3 -m fgmk

Dependencies
------------

This tool is written using Python 3. Needs ``pillow``, ``numpy`` and
``PyQt5`` - you can ``apt install python3-pyqt5`` and similar (in
Ubuntu) or use pip.

If you satisfy all dependencies you don't need to install, and can run
from source.

***Experimental compatibility to python2*** (2.7 and on) is added to
versions above 0.3.0 . Note that Python 2.7 pip doesn't provide an easy
way to install PyQt5 so you will have to install it on your own - if you
are in Ubuntu, use ``sudo apt install python-pyqt5``
