Welcome to FGMK's documentation!
================================

The FGMK project has the goal of building a transparent, easy to use and
hack, RPG game making tool.

The project seeks to reach this goal by providing a spec for writing and
interpret text files as games, a tool for writing these files in an easy
to use interface, and an engine to allow playing these files as a game.
