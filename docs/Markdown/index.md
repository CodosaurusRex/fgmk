# Documentation

The FGMK project has the goal of building a transparent, easy to use and hack,
RPG game making tool.

The project seeks to reach this goal by providing a spec for writing and
interpret text files as games, a tool for writing these files in an easy to use
interface, and an engine to allow playing these files as a game.

describes a RPG game with text.

- [`EditorCode`](EditorCode/EditorCode.md) - how the code of the graphic editor
is organized.

- [`Roadmap`](Roadmap/Roadmap.md) - what's planned and where we are going.

- [`Future`](Future/Future.md) - what could be done better starting from
scratch.
