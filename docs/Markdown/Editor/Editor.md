# Editor
Describes each part and screen of the Editor.

## Overview
How to build a game with the fgmk interface, what to expect.

## Actions System
The system expects actions, and deals with them in the first in first out order.

## The Map Editor
The central thing in the FGMK Games are the maps. This is where the player will
spend most of his time.

## Palette Editor
When you draw a map, it uses selected tiles, grouped in a palette, this is how
you make your own palettes.

## Item Editor
Itens are an important part of how the player interacts with the map. This is
where you make them.

## Charaset Editor
Charasets are a file that points to pieces of an image, and describe the
animations used by Charas (and the player chara).

## Charas Editor
Usually the NPCs you interact appear in the form of a Chara, in the Chara editor
you can set how a Chara moves or which actions would be executed.

# Still to be developed :

## Jokenpo Editor
Here you can set the elements available in your world, and how they relate with
each other (paper wins over rock).

## Heroes, Monsters and Skills Editor
You can calibrate how each hero should level up, develop new skills, and specify
the monsters.

## Scripted Battle Editor
Meaningful battles should work like puzzles, the scripted battle editor is
design for just that.
