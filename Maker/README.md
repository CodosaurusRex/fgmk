This is the editor. 

Running in Linux:
-----------------
I made using Python 2.7. Needs Pillow and PyQt4 - you can apt-get install python-pyqt4 or use pip.
Then cd to this folder and use 
 python Editor.py 


Running in Windows:
-------------------
I've successfully tested using ActiveState ActivePyton 2.7 for Windows x86. In windows, cd to \Python27\Scripts and use pypm: 
pypm.exe  install PyQt4 
pypm.exe install Pillow

Then cd to this folder and use
\Python27\Python.exe Editor.py

If it doesn't work, check if the environment variable are seted: PYTHONPATH must point to C:\Python27.
