![Icon](iconTiny.png) This folder should not be packaged!
=========================================================

This folder contains things that are helpers in making the fgmk Editor.
This folder should not be packaged or pushed to pypi.

The contents here are:

 - `basegame` : a folder containing what's unpacked when you click New Project and select a folder.

 - `example` : a folder containing what's unpacked when you click Load Example in a temp folder.

 ## Updating fgmk example game and new project game

 Just run the `update_fgmk_data.sh` script, it will create the needed packages.
